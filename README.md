# A12-Effect-Size

Matlab code to compute A12 effect size proposed in the following paper:

AndrÃ¡s Vargha and Harold D. Delaney. A Critique and Improvement of the "CL" Common Language Effect Size Statistics of McGraw and Wong. Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, Vol. 25, No. 2 (Summer, 2000), pp.101-132

and explained in

Andrea Arcuri and Lionel Briand. A Practical Guide for Using Statistical Tests to Assess Randomized. Algorithms in Software Engineering.
 
 
As explained by the latter, a12 measures the probability that running algorithm x yields higher values of the measurement taken than running another algorithm y. For example, A12 = 0.7 entails we would obtain higher results 70% of the time with algorithm x.

In this implementation, if x is larger than y, return the usual a12(x,y).
Otherwise, return -1 * a12(y,x).

According to Vargha and Delaney, a small, medium, large difference between two populations:
+ Big is A12 >= 0.71
+ Medium is A12 >=0.64
+ Small is A12 >= 0.56

This repository contains one standard implementation of A12 effect size, for instance used in the following paper:

MINKU, L.; HOU, S.. "Clustering Dycom: An Online Cross-Company Software Effort Estimation Study", Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Predictive Models and Data Analytics in Software Engineering (PROMISE), November 2017.

It also contains two temporal versions of A12, where A12 is computed multiple times across time. The window-based version (a12temporal2.m) was used in the following paper:

MINKU, L.L.; YAO, X. . "Which Models of the Past Are Relevant to the Present? A software effort estimation approach to exploiting useful past models", Automated Software Engineering Journal, v. 24, n. 7, p. 499-542, September 2017, doi: 10.1007/s10515-016-0209-7.
